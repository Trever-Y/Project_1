## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

##Read in Data

```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/EDU01a.csv")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
